# Decisions

append-only log of significant decisions and why.

2026-02-21 — bootstrapped bny dark factory tooling into destroysass. adapted dev scripts for next.js (tsc --noEmit for post_flight, npm run build for test, curl vercel for health). kept bny scripts as-is since they're runtime-agnostic orchestration. wrote qa-playbook.md as persistent memory for how to verify the live app via browser relay.

2026-02-21 — set roadmap: 001 landing page first (brand before features), then 002 idea board, 003 submission, 004 pledge mechanic. rationale: nothing on the homepage currently communicates the vision — fix that before building any data model.
