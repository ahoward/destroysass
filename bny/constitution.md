# Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. POD Only (Plain Old Data)

All data structures MUST be Plain Old Data. No classes for data containers.

- Input and output are always JSON-serializable POD
- No `class` keyword for data structures
- No inheritance hierarchies for data
- Types are interfaces or type aliases only
- Functions transform POD → POD

**Rationale:** Classes obscure data shape, complicate serialization, and introduce hidden state. POD is transparent, debuggable, and universal.

### II. Antagonistic Testing

Tests are specifications. Claude designs, Gemini challenges, then implement.

- Claude (primary agent) designs first pass of tests
- Gemini (antagonist) reviews tests, finds blind spots, suggests harder cases
- After Gemini review, tests are LOCKED
- Human checkpoint ONLY when stuck (cannot make tests pass)
- Tests MUST exist before implementation

**Rationale:** Single-agent test design has blind spots. Adversarial review produces robust specifications. Tests define the contract; implementations are disposable.

### III. Unix-Clean

We follow Unix conventions, not JavaScript conventions.

- `null` over `undefined` (explicit absence)
- stdin/stdout/stderr for I/O
- Exit codes matter (0 = success, non-zero = failure)
- Streams and pipes where appropriate
- Simple text protocols (JSON lines, etc.)

**Rationale:** Unix conventions are battle-tested, composable, and universal. JavaScript's `undefined` is an accident of history.

### IV. Simplicity (YAGNI)

Start simple. Add complexity only when proven necessary.

- No premature abstractions
- No "just in case" features
- Three similar lines > one premature abstraction
- If unsure, leave it out
- Complexity MUST be justified in writing

**Rationale:** Over-engineering is the enemy. Every abstraction has a cost. Pay it only when the benefit is clear and present.

## Naming Conventions

| Thing | Style | Example |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Constants | SCREAMING_SNAKE | `MAX_SIZE`, `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT` |
| Types/Interfaces | PascalCase | `FileRecord`, `UserConfig` |
| Variables/functions | snake_case | `file_path`, `compute_hash` |

**Note:** This differs from typical JS/TS camelCase. We use Ruby-style snake_case.

## Terminology

- `params` for input (6 chars)
- `result` for output (6 chars)
- Never use "data"—too generic

## Development Workflow

### The Loop

1. **Design Interface** — Define public API
2. **Design Tests (Claude)** — Write test cases
3. **Review Tests (Gemini)** — Antagonist review, incorporate suggestions
4. **Implement** — Write code
5. **Loop Until Green** — Fix failures, re-run tests
6. **If Stuck → Human Checkpoint** — Only when tests cannot pass

### Never

- Implement without tests
- Skip Gemini review
- Change tests after review without human approval
- Move to next task with failing tests
- Use classes for data structures

## Governance

### Amendment Process

1. Propose change with rationale
2. Document in constitution with version bump
3. Update dependent artifacts if principles change

### Versioning

- **MAJOR**: Principle removed or redefined (breaking)
- **MINOR**: Principle added or materially expanded
- **PATCH**: Clarifications, wording, typos

**Version**: 1.0.0
