## tldr (non-technical)

ai lets anyone build an app overnight. keeping it working as the internet changes around it is
impossibly expensive for normal people. big corporations will use this to build private systems,
hoarding the benefits and extracting our wealth. meanwhile, the everyday internet becomes a
chaotic mess. to fight back and own our tools, we must form co-ops to fund, build, and maintain
custom software designed for our actual needs — not theirs.

## tldr (technical)

gen-ai has collapsed the traditional saas model, not by driving dev costs to zero, but by
accelerating the entropy of integrations. the true cost of software is evolution and
interconnectivity in a rapidly mutating landscape. megacorps will internalize ai-driven dev into
walled gardens. the consumer space devolves into an unmaintainable soup of fragmented scripts.
the solution is a middle path: localized tech stacks for dozens-to-hundreds of users, sustained
through legal cooperatives (lcas) and daos.

## the real cost of software

everyone says saas is dead. they misunderstand why.

gen-ai hasn't driven the cost of software to zero. it has fundamentally altered the economics.
the real cost of software has never been the initial build. it is the 80% total cost of
ownership spent on **maintaining it** and evolving its interconnectivity with other systems.

updating an isolated piece of code has no value. software only holds power through its
interactions — via apis, protocols, integrations. in the era of ai programming, these
foundations move at an unfathomable speed. developers can write applications overnight, but the
underlying landscape shifts beneath them before the ink is dry.

if a dev team uses ai to build 50x faster, the corporate employer won't pay them the delta. if
they don't use ai, they get shot in the back by a faster competitor burning a billion tokens a
day. the sheer velocity of change makes long-term consumer saas mathematically unviable.

**if you are building a massive b2c saas product right now, stop.**

## the app factory illusion

there are executives right now, getting their industry news from twitter, hallucinating that an
"app factory" that one-shots an application in two clicks is the future of software. this
displays a staggering ignorance of thirty years of software engineering.

development costs represent 5-10% of total cost of ownership. the rest is maintenance, security,
evolution, devops. so what if ai reduces the cost of a $500k app to $450k? congratulations,
you've built a to-do list slop machine that will work for exactly 24 hours before the ecosystem
shifts beneath it.

worse: the people peddling these app factories are openly telegraphing their endgame. the massive
ai entities are talking about going straight to binary. when you use their software factory,
**they will own those apps.** they will keep the source code and hand you a compiled binary. the
ultimate gen-ai version of drm. or they will legally claim ownership of the solution because
you simply gave them a problem statement. nothing more.

any software paradigm today has two, and only two, questions to answer:

1. **why do we own it?**
2. **how do we control it?**

giving up the source code means handing the keys of your digital life to the corporate borg.

## the power inversion

because maintaining software is now the ultimate bottleneck, we are witnessing a massive power
inversion.

inside mega-corporations, where business practices are stable, there is an economic win for
automation. they will stop paying $2,700 a month for saas products they can now develop
internally. they will re-imagine computing from the ground up, consolidating into highly
maintained, proprietary walled gardens.

the consumer space looks entirely different. a phd student might vibe-code a brilliant
medication monitor, but they will never afford the maintenance required to keep it afloat in a
constantly shifting digital landscape. centralized mass-market tools are going the way of the
dodo, leaving ordinary citizens with a chaotic proto-methean soup of tiny slingshots to use
against corporate giants.

this is exactly what richard stallman warned us about in the 80s. we ignored his manifestos one
by one. now we face a techno-fascist reality where corporations, not governments, surveil and
dictate our lives.

## the middle path

the internet was built on the backs of open-source contributors who gave away millions of hours
of labor to democratize power. 98% of the web servers in the world still run on open-source
software. if we want the internet to work in our favor, we need a new economic model.

we must abandon the dream of one massive service with a million users.  
we must also reject the trap of "app factories" that steal our ip.  
we need the middle path.

the evolution of saas is **community-scale software**. tools designed for dozens or hundreds of
users. built for the specific constraints of a local environment. boulder food rescue works
because a custom tech stack coordinates volunteer bicyclists in a city where you can ride 360
days a year. that exact same model is completely useless in the icy darkness of anchorage, alaska.

to make this economically viable and legally defensible, we must establish a new paradigm:
linking **limited cooperative associations (lcas)** with **decentralized autonomous organizations
(daos)**. this creates legal and financial entities capable of collectively funding and paying
for the ongoing existence of shared software.

by pooling resources, ordinary businesses can finally afford the true cost of software
maintenance — and retain absolute ownership of the source code.

**our aim is to harm the massive corporate extractors financially through a new model of
empowering citizens with technology.**
